android-whatever-api
========================

## DEPRECATED This lib is not supported anymore, the idea is very close to the [ContextCompat](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/ContextCompat.html) class.

WhateverApi is an Android library that helps you to get ride of the boring code

    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.SOME_ANDROID_API) {
        androidAwesomeMethod();
    } else {
        androidDeprecatedMethod();
    }

### Installation

Add this to your `build.gradle` file

	repositories {
	    maven {
	        url "https://jitpack.io"
	    }
	}

	dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.quentin7b:android-whatever-api:1.0.0'
	}

Please note that *WhateverApi* has some dependencies:

	compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.0'

### Use it

We wanted to do that as simple as it is.

If you know that your method is deprecated, just search for the class _*WEApi*classname_.

For example: the `Resources` [class of *android*](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Resources.html) searchfor `WEApiResources` class

Once you have your *class*, every method is *public static*, so you can use it as it without creating an object

About the *method* to use. Let's go back to `Resources`, guess you want a *color*
Just call

	int color = WEApiResources.getColor(resources, colorResId, theme);
	
If you're on 23+, it will return `resources.getColor(colorResId, theme);` but if you're 23-, then it will return `resources.getColor(colorResId);`
	

### Understand it

All the classes belongs to the package they are on android, but within `com.github.quentin7b`
For example, `Resources` of *android* is in `android.content.res`, so in *WhateverApi* it is in `com.github.quentin7b.android.content.res`

### Contribution

If something is missing and you want it. There are 2 ways to do that:
* open an issue and we'll add it (asap)
* fork, do it by yourself, pull request it and we'll review it (asap too)

If you add a method, just follow the way everything is done:

	/**
	 * Describes method <br />
	 * More info (optional, like min API) <br />
	 * Deprecated in API _No_
	 *
	 * @param all the params
	 * @return the return value
	 */
	 public static <returnType> recentApiCall(params) {
	 	if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.DEPRECATED_API_VERSION) {
     		return recentApiCall(some, params);
     	} else {
        	return deprecatedApiCall(some, params);
     	}
	 }

Notice that the *signature* of the method should be the same in the *latest API*

Thanks :)
